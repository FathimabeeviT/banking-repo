# banking-repo
Project Overview:
The project is a simple banking system implemented in Python. It allows users to create accounts, log in, deposit money, withdraw money, check their balance, and make donations.

Key Features:

Account Creation: Users can create an account by providing a username and a password. The password must be at least 8 characters long.

Login System: Users can log in with their username and password. The system verifies the credentials and grants access upon successful login.

Deposit Functionality: Users can deposit money into their account. The system ensures that only positive amounts are deposited.

Withdrawal Functionality: Users can withdraw money from their account, provided they have sufficient funds. The system prevents withdrawals of non-positive amounts or amounts exceeding the account balance.

Balance Inquiry: Users can check their account balance at any time.

Donation Feature: Users can choose to donate money from their account balance. Similar to withdrawals, donations are only allowed if the user has sufficient funds.

Project Execution:

The BankAccount class encapsulates the account-related functionalities such as account creation, login, deposit, withdrawal, donation, and balance inquiry.
The main() function serves as the entry point to the banking system. It presents users with a menu-driven interface to interact with their accounts.
Users are prompted to select options like login, deposit, withdrawal, balance inquiry, donation, or logout. Invalid inputs are handled gracefully with appropriate error messages.
The program ensures data integrity by validating inputs and enforcing constraints (e.g., minimum password length, positive amounts for deposits/withdrawals/donations).
Potential Enhancements:

Implementing persistent storage: Currently, account data is not stored persistently. Incorporating a database or file-based storage system could make the application more robust.
Adding transaction history: Tracking account transactions would provide users with a detailed history of their financial activities.
Improving security: Implementing stronger password policies, such as requiring a mix of alphanumeric characters and symbols, can enhance account security.


Conclusion:

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming and user interaction in Python. It provides a foundation for building more complex banking applications and understanding software design principles.
